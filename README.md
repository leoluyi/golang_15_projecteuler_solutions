## Problem 1 --- Multiples of 3 and 5

> "If we list all the natural numbers below **10** that are multiples of **3** or **5**, we get **3**, **5, 6** and **9**. The sum of these multiples is **23**.
>
> Find the sum of all the multiples of **3** or **5** below **1000**."

OK, this seems to be some sort of [fizz buzz problem.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fizz_buzz) Being the first problem, it shouldn't be that hard, right? The solution is as follows:

```go
package main
import "fmt"func main() {
    sum := 0
    for i := 1; i < 1_000; i++ {
        if i%3 == 0 || i%5 == 0 {
            sum += i
        }
    }
    fmt.Printf("Sum: %d\n", sum)
}
```

Output:

```
Sum: 233168
```

It wasn't that hard. What is interesting here is, perhaps, the usage of the [number literal prefix](https://golang.org/ref/spec#Integer_literals) `_` to help with readability. There are some refactoring opportunities here that we will revisit later in this article. Let's move to the next problem🙂.

## **Problem 2 ---** Even Fibonacci numbers

> "Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:
>
> 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...
>
> By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms."

This one is getting interesting. How can we generate the Fibonacci sequence in Go? This way:

```go
func main() {
    a := 0
    b := 1
    for i := 0; i < 10; i++ {
        fmt.Println(a)
        copy := a + b
        a = b
        b = copy
    }
}
```

Actually, we could avoid an assignment statement swapping those two variables using this way:

```go
func main() {
    a := 0
    b := 1
    for i := 0; i < 10; i++ {
        ret := a
        a, b = b, a+ret
        fmt.Println(ret)
    }
}
```

Cool, isn't it?🙂 This gives us the sequence but doesn't really solve the problem. We need to sum the even numbers *< 4000000*. This was my solution:

```go
package main
import "fmt"

sfunc main() {
    a := 0
    b := 1
    sum := 0
    const max = 4_000_000    for b < max {
        buff := a + b
        if b%2 == 0 {
            sum += b
        }
        a = b
        b = buff
    }    fmt.Printf("The sum is: [%d]\n", sum)
}
```

This time I use **const** to make a clear difference between variables and constants. I think it would probably be the same to use the following:

```go
for b < 4_000_000 {
```

As I said, the aim is to have some fun and put some concepts into practice. We can also see that this time the number literal prefix `_` helps with readability.

Output:

```
The sum is: [4613732]
```

Problem 2 --- solution

It runs very fast. Let's move to the next problem.

## **Problem 3 ---** Largest prime factor

> "The prime factors of **13195** are **5**, **7**, **13** and **29**.
>
> What is the largest prime factor of the number 600851475143?"

Cool! This one involves **prime factorization.** You won't have any problem finding programming solutions for prime factorization. One of the most common solutions is the [Trial Division algorithm.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial_division) First, let's see how to decompose the number in primes, and then we will take care of checking what is the largest later.

```go
package main
import (
    "fmt"
    "math"
)

func printPrimes(n int) {
    for i := 2; i <= int(math.Sqrt(float64(n))); i++ {
        if n%i == 0 {
            fmt.Println(i)
            n /= i
            i--
        }
    }
    if n > 0 {
        fmt.Println(n)
    }
}

func main() {
    n := 600851475143
    printPrimes(n)
}
```

Output:

```
71
839
1471
6857
```

![Image of solution on computer.](https://miro.medium.com/max/1276/1*I6YLccDLj0FiNAZbCYgGAQ.png)

It works, but I am pretty sure we could optimize it. We can also see that the largest number is **6,857**, so we are done solving this problem! Let's see how we can calculate the largest value using the previous code. First, we need to change our `printPrimes()` function to return a slice of the prime factors. The code has been changed to the following:

```go
func primeFactors(n int) []int {
    factors := make([]int, 0)

    for i := 2; i <= int(math.Sqrt(float64(n))); i++ {
        if n%i == 0 {
            factors = append(factors, i)
            n /= i
            i--
        }
    }

  if n > 0 {
        factors = append(factors, n)
    }
    return factors
}
```

Great, now let's create a function to calculate the largest as follows:

```go
func largest(factors []int) int {
    max := factors[0]
    for _, factor := range factors {
        if factor > max {
            max = factor
        }
    }
    return max
}
```

The full program is as follows:

```go
package main
import (
    "fmt"
    "math"
)

func largest(factors []int) int {
    max := factors[0]
    for _, factor := range factors {
        if factor > max {
            max = factor
        }
    }
    return max
}

func primeFactors(n int) []int {
    factors := make([]int, 0)
    for i := 2; i <= int(math.Sqrt(float64(n))); i++ {
        if n%i == 0 {
            factors = append(factors, i)
            n /= i
            i--
        }
    }
    if n > 0 {
        factors = append(factors, n)
    }
    return factors
}

func main() {
    n := 600851475143
    largestPrimeFactor := largest(primeFactors(n))
    fmt.Println(largestPrimeFactor)
}
```

Output:

```
6857
```

Actually, while writing this part of this article, we could have also used the [factor linux command](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/factor.1.html) shown below:

## **Problem 4 ---** Largest palindrome product

> "A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from the product of two **2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 × 99**.
>
> Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers."

OK, how do we know if a number is a palindrome? The first approach would be to convert the number to `string`, reverse the `string `and then check if the reversed `string `is the same as the number. But that sounds complicated. So, let's try a function. The following function reverses a number without using `string`- related operations:

```go
func isPalindrome(n int) bool {
    reverse := 0
    original := n
    for n != 0 {
        reverse = (reverse * 10) + (n % 10)
        n /= 10
    }
    return original == reverse
}
```

We need to find the largest palindrome made from a product of two 3-digit numbers. We may need to start checking from 100.... This solution is as follows:

```go
package main
import "fmt"

func isPalindrome(n int) bool {
    reverse := 0
    original := n
    for n != 0 {
        reverse = (reverse * 10) + (n % 10)
        n /= 10
    }
    return original == reverse
}

func main() {
    max := 999
    for i := 100; i <= 999; i++ {
        for j := 100; j <= 999; j++ {
            product := i * j
            if isPalindrome(product) && product > max {
                max = product
            }
        }
    }
    fmt.Println(max)
}
```

Output:

```
906609
```

I am pretty sure we could optimize it, but even without optimization (as you see below), it runs very fast:

```
$ time ./problem4
906609real    0m0.045s
user    0m0.042s
sys 0m0.005s
```

< 0.05 seconds!

## **Problem 5 ---** Smallest multiple

> "**2520** is the smallest number that can be divided by each of the numbers from **1** to **10** without any remainder.
>
> What is the smallest positive number that is evenly divisible by all of the numbers from **1** to **20**?"

It seems that for this one, we need to keep track of the numbers that can be divided in a range, 1--10--1--20. I wrote the following code to solve it:

```go
package main
import "fmt"

func main() {
    max := 2520
    for i := max; ; i++ {
        can := true
        for j := 1; j <= 20; j++ {
            if i % j != 0 {
                can = false
                break
            }
        }
        if can {
            max = i
            break
        }
    }
    fmt.Println(max)
}
```

Unfortunately, the program doesn't run as fast as the other ones. The results are shown below:

```
$ time ./problem5
232792560real    0m7.032s
user    0m7.029s
sys 0m0.012s
```

## Problem 6 --- Sum square difference

> "The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,

![Image of equation.](https://miro.medium.com/max/444/1*geJwuFKylv6QTWOnOXpUkg.png)

> The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,

> Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is .
>
> Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum."

This is probably the easiest 😃. Here's my answer:

```go
package main
import "fmt"

func main() {
    sumSquares := 0
    squaresOfTheSum := 0
    for i := 1; i <= 100; i++ {
        sumSquares += i * i
        squaresOfTheSum += i
    }
    diffSums := (squaresOfTheSum * squaresOfTheSum) - sumSquares
    fmt.Println(diffSums)
}
```

Output:

```
$ time ./problem6
25164150real    0m0.004s
user    0m0.000s
sys 0m0.005s
```

## Problem 7--10001st prime

> "By listing the first six prime numbers: **2, 3, 5, 7, 11**, and **13**, we can see that the **6th prime** is **13**.
>
> What is the **10 001st** prime number?"

In previous problems, we have seen how to know if a number is prime. For this problem, we need to get the `nth `number.

**Solution:**

```go
package main
import (
    "fmt"
    "math"
)

func nThPrimeNumber(n int) int {
    if n == 0 {
        return 0
    }

    count := 0
    i := 2
    for ; ; i++ {
        if isPrime(i) {
            count++
        }
        if count == n {
            break
        }
    }
    return i
}

func isPrime(n int) bool {
    if n < 2 {
        return false
    }

    is := true
    max := math.Sqrt(float64(n))

    for i := 2; i <= int(max); i++ {
        if n % i == 0 {
            is = false
            break
        }
    }
    return is
}

func main() {
    fmt.Println(nThPrimeNumber(10_001))
}
```

We could optimize it but, as you can see below, it runs very fast:

```
$ time ./problem7
104743real    0m0.093s
user    0m0.094s
sys 0m0.001s
```

It takes ~1.2 seconds on my computer 😮

> Find the thirteen adjacent digits in the **1000-digit** number that have the greatest product. What is the value of this product?"

This one is really interesting! The first thing we need to do is to *flat this 1000-digit number* in a `string` for easy manipulation and then go from the position `0` to `***string.length - 13\***` and calculate the largest product. My answer is shown below:

The code to convert a `digit-char` to an `int` is very common. You take the `char `and subtract it with `*0*`. That will convert the `char `to `int`.

This seems to be a good candidate for a brute-force solution. My answer is shown below:

```go
package main
import "fmt"

func main() {
    out:
    for a := 1; a < 1_000; a++ {
        for b := 1; b < 1_000; b++ {
            for c := 1; c < 1_000; c++ {
                if ((a * a) + (b * b) == (c * c)) && (a + b + c == 1_000) && ((a < b) && (b < c)) {
                    product := a * b * c
                    fmt.Printf("%d + %d + %d = 1000, product = %d\n", a, b, c, product)
                    break out
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

Output:

```

For this one, we will need to re-use our `*isPrime()*` function. Basically, we need to go from **2** to the **2000000** and check every number. If it is prime, then add it up to a variable.

This was my solution:

```go
package main
import (
    "fmt"
    "math"
)

func isPrime(n int) bool {
    if n < 2 {
        return false
    }

    is := true
    max := int(math.Sqrt(float64(n)))

    for i := 2; i <= max; i++ {
        if n % i == 0 {
            is = false
            break
        }
    }
    return is
}

func main() {
    sum := 0
    for i := 2; i <= 2_000_000; i++ {
        if isPrime(i) {
            sum += i
        }
    }
    fmt.Println(sum)
}
```

The `*isPrime()*` function is not fully optimized, but works, and the whole solution runs fast enough (***< 1.5sec\***). Results are shown below:

This is probably one of the most laborious. The problem is simple, being at a specific position (row, col), but how can we move in a specific direction and get the product of the four adjacent numbers? The conditions are different for any direction and position. One of the things I love the most about this problem is that we can practice several topics such as:

- Constants with [***iota\***](https://golang.org/ref/spec#Iota)
- Polymorphism
- String conversions (we need to convert the numbers in the 20x20 grid)
- Switch clause
- Pointers and more

The first thing I did for this problem was to put the grid in a `string` and write a function to convert the grid text to a slice of slices. My answer is shown below:

```go
const (
    grid = `08 02 22 97 38 15 00 40 00 75 04 05 07 78 52 12 50 77 91 08

    gridRowLen = 20
    adjacent = 4
)

func gridTextToMatrix2(grid string, matrixSize int) [][]int {
    matrix := make([][]int, matrixSize)
    for i := 0; i < matrixSize; i++ {
        matrix[i] = make([]int, matrixSize)
    }
    
    textRows := strings.Split(grid, "\n")

    for i := 0; i < len(textRows); i++ {
        row := textRows[i]
        cols := strings.Split(row, " ")
        for c := 0; c < len(cols); c++ {
            x, _ := strconv.ParseInt(cols[c], 10, 64)
            matrix[i][c] = int(x)
        }
    }
    return matrix
}
```

This should work. Now, how can we handle the different types of movements? Up, down, left, right or diagonal. I have handled that with an `iota` type as follows:

```go
type Direction intconst (
    Down Direction = iota
    Up
    Left
    Right
    DiagonalUpLeft
    DiagonalUpRight
    DiagonalDownLeft
    DiagonalDownRight
)
```

Having this type, now we can use our `Direction` type with polymorphism in my functions. My answer is shown below:

```go
func canMove(row, col, adjacent int, direction Direction, grid *[][]int) bool {
    switch direction {
    case Right:
        if ((col + adjacent) > len(*grid)) || (row >= len(*grid)) {
            return false
        }
        return true
    case Left:
        if (((col + 1) - adjacent) < 0) || (row >= len(*grid)) {
            return false
        }
        return true
    case Up:
        if ((col < 0) || (col >= len(*grid))) || (((row + 1) - adjacent) < 0) {
            return false
        }
        if (row + 1) > len(*grid) {
            return false
        }
        return true
    case Down:
        if ((col < 0) || (col >= len(*grid))) || ((row + adjacent) > len(*grid)) {
            return false
        }
        return true
    case DiagonalUpLeft:
        if ((col + 1) - adjacent) < 0 {
            return false
        }
        if ((row + 1) - adjacent) < 0 {
            return false
        }
        if (row + 1) > len(*grid) {
            return false
        }
        return true
    case DiagonalUpRight:
        if ((row + 1) - adjacent) < 0 {
            return false
        }
        if (col + adjacent) > len(*grid) {
            return false
        }
        if row >= len(*grid) {
            return false
        }
        return true
    case DiagonalDownLeft:
        if (col < 0) || (col >= len(*grid)) {
            return false
        }
        if (row + adjacent) > len(*grid) {
            return false
        }
        if ((col + 1) - adjacent) < 0 {
            return false
        }
        return true;
    case DiagonalDownRight:
        if (col + adjacent) > len(*grid) {
            return false
        }
        if row >= len(*grid) {
            return false
        }
        if (col < 0) || (col >= len(*grid)) {
            return false
        }
        if (row + adjacent) > len(*grid) {
            return false
        }
        return true
    default:
        return false
    }
}

func availableMoves(row, col int, grid *[][]int) []Direction {
    directions := []Direction{
        Down,
        Up,
        Left,
        Right,
        DiagonalUpLeft,
        DiagonalUpRight,
        DiagonalDownLeft,
        DiagonalDownRight,
    }

    available := make([]Direction, 0)
    for _, direction := range directions {
        if canMove(row, col, adjacent, direction, grid) {
            available = append(available, direction)
        }
    }
    return available
}
```

Unfortunately, there is no way to get rid of these lengthy functions. We must consider all the cases. The following function will calculate the product of the adjacent for a `direction` being on a specific [row, column]:

```go
func calculate(direction Direction, row, col, adjacent int, grid *[][]int) int {
    switch direction {
    case Right:
        p := 1
        for c := col; c < (col + adjacent); c++ {
            p *= (*grid)[row][c]
        }
        return p
    case Left:
        p := 1
        for c := col; c > (col - adjacent); c-- {
            p *= (*grid)[row][c]
        }
        return p
    case Up:
        p := 1
        for r := row; r > (row - adjacent); r-- {
            p *= (*grid)[r][col]
        }
        return p;
    case Down:
        p := 1
        for r := row; r < (row + adjacent); r++ {
            p *= (*grid)[r][col]
        }
        return p
    case DiagonalUpLeft:
        p := 1
        c := col
        for r := row; (r > (row - adjacent)) && (c > (c - adjacent));  {
            p *= (*grid)[r][c]
            r--
            c--
        }
        return p
    case DiagonalUpRight:
        p := 1
        r := row
        c := col
        for ; (r > (row - adjacent)) && (c < (col + adjacent)); {
            p *= (*grid)[r][c]
            r--
            c++
        }
        return p
    case DiagonalDownLeft:
        p := 1
        r := row
        c := col
        for ; r < (row + adjacent) && (c > (col - adjacent));  {
        p *= (*grid)[r][c]
            r++
            c--
        }
        return p
    case DiagonalDownRight:
        p := 1
        r := row
        c := col
        for ; (r < (row + adjacent)) && (c < (col + adjacent));  {
        p *= (*grid)[r][c]
            r++
            c++
        }
        return p
    default:
        return 0
    }
}
```

Let's see how to brute-force it first. The first naive approach would be the following:

```go
package main
import "fmt"

func main() {
    n := 1
    triangle := 0
    for ;; {
        triangle += n
        numberOfDivisors := 0
        for i := 1; i <= triangle; i++ {
            if triangle % i == 0 {
                numberOfDivisors++
            }
        }
        if numberOfDivisors >= 300 {
            fmt.Printf("triangle: %d has %d divisors\n", triangle, numberOfDivisors)
            break
        }
        n++
    }
}
```

The solution is able to find the first number having over 300 divisors in around 13 seconds as shown by the results below:

```
$ time ./problem12
triangle: 2162160 has 320 divisorsreal    0m12.920s
user    0m12.917s
sys 0m0.016s
```

When trying to find the first number having over ***500 divisors\***, the above algorithm is really, really slow.

**Highly composite triangular numbers**

After some research and frustration, I found that these numbers are called "Highly composite triangular numbers". The list can be found in [The On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences](https://oeis.org/A076711). We have our solution there, and the number we are looking for is ***76576500\***.

The overview problem solution gives us the following help:

> "It can be improved somewhat by halting divisions when the divisor exceeds the square root of the triangle number. For every exact divisor up to the square root, there is a corresponding divisor above the square root."

After changing my algorithm with this help, I came up with the following:

```go
package main
import (
    "fmt"
    "math"
)

func main() {
    n := 1
    triangle := 0
    for {
        triangle += n
        numberOfDivisors := 0
        to := int(math.Sqrt(float64(triangle)))
        for i := 1; i <= to; i++ {
            if triangle%i == 0 {
                numberOfDivisors += 2
            }
        }
        if numberOfDivisors >= 500 {
            fmt.Printf("triangle: %d has %d divisors\n", triangle, numberOfDivisors)
            break
        }
        n++
    }
}
```

As shown below, the solution is found in less than a second!

This one is interesting too. It is clear that a primitive number won't be able to hold the sum of all these numbers, so we will need to use [*big numbers*](https://golang.org/pkg/math/big/)*.* The solution, as follows, turns out to be very simple:

```go
package main
import (
    "fmt"
    "math/big"
    "strings"
)

const numText = `37107287533902102798797998220837590246510135740250
... more numbers
...
`

func main() {
    sum := big.NewInt(0)
    for _, line := range strings.Split(numText, "\n") {
        n := new(big.Int)
        bn, _ := n.SetString(line, 10)
        sum.Add(sum, bn)
    }

    sumStr := sum.String()
    fmt.Println(sumStr[:10])
}
```

Output:

```
$ time ./problem13
5537376230real    0m0.006s
user    0m0.003s
sys 0m0.004s
```

## **Problem 14 ---** Longest Collatz sequence

My solution is:

```go
package main
import "fmt"

func main() {
    numberThatGeneratesTheLongestChain := 1
    chainLen := 1
    for i := 2; i <= 1_000_000; i++ {
        count := 1
        start := i
        for start != 1 {
            if start % 2 == 0 {
                start /= 2
            } else {
                start = start * 3 + 1
            }
            count++
        }
        if count > chainLen {
            chainLen = count
            numberThatGeneratesTheLongestChain = i
        }
    }
    fmt.Printf("%d generates %d\n", numberThatGeneratesTheLongestChain, chainLen)
}
```

The solution, shown below, was again brute-forced but it works (*< 0.2 seconds*):

```

user    0m0.240s

## **Problem 15 ---** Lattice paths

> Starting in the top left corner of a **2×2 grid**, and only being able to move to the right and down, there are exactly 6 routes to the bottom right corner.

![img](https://miro.medium.com/max/416/1*SWEPk2t_jZV1riF1MeKhGw.png)

> How many such routes are there through a **20×20 grid**?

This problem is called ["Lattice Paths"](https://www.robertdickau.com/lattices.html). These paths can be calculated using[ central binomial coefficients](https://www.robertdickau.com/manhattan.html), such as:

![img](https://miro.medium.com/max/66/1*tYoGWNWxCJG4dX3wMAJRkw.gif)

![img](https://miro.medium.com/max/74/1*70oB7mKEv-kd7lVZXXPCgw.gif)

n = 20

The solution can be checked with Wolfram Alpha, which is linked below:

[wolframalpha.com](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=n+%3D+20%3B+(2+*+n)!+%2F+(n!)^2)

![img](https://miro.medium.com/max/604/1*eMPgpRcZd1dnBbol5Ns9og.png)

As you can see, the solution involves using a factorial function. The problem is that we need to calculate a factorial for the 40 number that would overflow type. We will need to use big numbers again. Let's write a factorial function using big numbers that will help us to calculate `(2 * n)! / (n!)²`:

```go
package main
import (
    "fmt"
    "math/big"
)

func factorial(n int) *big.Int {
    f := big.NewInt(1)
    for i := 1; i <= n; i++ {
        f.Mul(f, big.NewInt(int64(i)))
    }
    return f
}

func main() {
    // n = 20; (2 * n)! / (n!)^2    n := 20
    a := factorial(2  * n)
    b := factorial(n)
    b.Mul(b, b)
    result := new(big.Int)
    result.Div(a, b)
    fmt.Println(result)
}
```

Output:

```
$ time ./problem15
137846528820real    0m0.005s
user    0m0.001s
sys 0m0.005s
```

# My Strategy To Learn the Basics of a Programming Language

Say I want to learn Ruby, or Nim, or Clojure, or Haskell, I would create an account on Project Euler and try to solve the first 15 problems.

Once I am done, I go back to the first problem and try to change the code based on the refactoring techniques I know from other programming languages.

For example, for the first problem I used the following condition:

```go
if i % 3 == 0 || i % 5 == 0 {
    sum += i
}
```

I could actually change it to the followiong:

```go
package main
import "fmt"

func isDivisibleBy3Or5(n int) bool {
    return n % 3 == 0 || n % 5 == 0
}

func main() {
    sum := 0
    for i := 1; i < 1_000; i++ {
        if isDivisibleBy3Or5(i) {
            sum += i
        }
    }
    fmt.Printf("Sum: %d\n", sum)
}
```

And then ask myself, "Is this idiomatic?". And then, dig about it and move forward.
